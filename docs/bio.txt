Brian Junker-Latocha's rhythmic Americana roots and foot-tapping folkpop melodies are what happens when you put an east-coast American guitar player into the fertile German soil, pour some beer over top, and wait for him to grow.

On his off days, you'll find Brian stomping and strumming to the fiddle and banjo of his old-time folk band. 

Rhythm & Rhyme is about converting that same feel-good folk mindset into contemporary originals that keep you looking up and put a spring in your step while they're at it. 

At the crossroads of americana and country, Brian's debut album goes its own way. You'll find catchy choruses, but also a depth of instrumentation that lends color and contrast. Authentic melodies combine with traditional rhythyms to create the ideal roadtrip soundtrack-- whether down the Blue Ridge Parkway-- or across the Autobahn.

So buckle up, turn the key, and crank up the stereo. And let Brian Junker-Latocha make your day a ride to remember.
