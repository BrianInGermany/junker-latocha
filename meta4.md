Meta4 Cards are a team communication and ideation tool. They help you to reflect together on previous work, and identify risks and opportunities in upcoming tasks.

## How does it work?
### Make
Download the pdf by clicking the above image. Then print on cardstock, or use regular paper and glue to colorful construction paper.

### Reflect
The scrum master draws or chooses a card from the deck to reflect upon, and presents it. Team members write feedback on sticky notes for either the positive metaphor, the negative one, or both. Repeat this step as desired.

### Prioritize
After recording feedback stickies for each card, each team member selects their top three and puts them on the board.

### Cluster
Once the stickies are on the board, they can be clustered as a team into topics.

### Vote
Vote on the clusters to identify the most important action points or experiences to remember for the future.

### Act
Optimize your workflow by putting the team's feedback into effect.
